# Flash-Card-Project

Here, this program shows you the front and the backside of the 
card. For eg, in French ‘vieux’, means ‘old’ in English. After 3 
seconds the card flips and I can check whether I knew the answer. 
If I got it right, I’ll press ‘tick’ symbol and if I got it wrong, I’ll 
press the ‘cross’ symbol. And when I press ‘tick’, it’s going to 
take that flash card out of all of the list of flash cards so it doesn’t
show me the things I already know. This can be a very good way 
to learn a language.
